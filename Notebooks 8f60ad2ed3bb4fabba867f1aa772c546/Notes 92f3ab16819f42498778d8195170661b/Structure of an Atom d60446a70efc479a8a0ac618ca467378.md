# Waves

## Properties of Waves

1. The electric field and the magnetic field are perpendicular to each other and also perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
2. Electromagnetic wave do not require a medium and can move in vacuum.
3. Different kind of units are used to represent electromagnetic radiation.

### Electromagnetic Spectrum

The small portion around $10^{15}$Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible light. It is the only portion that is visible to the naked eye.

Special instruments are required to detect non-visible radiation.

# Wave Nature of Light

Light is considered as an electromagnetic spectrum in which the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other.

---

Where $E$ is the Energy of the EMR and $\nu$ is the frequency of the EMR

$$E \propto \nu$$

Also, 
Speed of Light of all EMR is $c=3\times 10^8$

---

$\Large c = \nu \times \lambda$

---

# Particle Nature of Light

## Planck's Quantum Theory

Light consists of small (massless) particles of energy, that are called **Photons or  Quantum.**

---

1. The Energy of the photon is directly proportional to $\nu$

    $$E_o \propto \nu$$

    ---

    $$\therefore E_o = h \times \nu$$

    $$\therefore E_o = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$

    where $h=6.626\times 10^{-34} \space J/s$

2. The Energy of photons is quantized in nature because a photon is either completely emitted or absorbed or it is not emitted or absorbed

    $$E_o = 1h\nu , 2h\nu ,3h\nu
    \\\\
    E_o \neq 1.5h\nu , 2.7h\nu$$

## Photoelectric Effect

When a beam of light with sufficient energy strikes certain metals then it ejects the electrons from the metal surface. These electrons are called **photoelectrons** and the phenomenon is called **photoelectric effect**.

1. The electrons ejected

## Einstein's Equation for the Photoelectric Effect

### Work Function

Minimum amount of Energy required to just eject the electron from the metal surface.

$$\phi = h \nu_o = \frac{hc}{\lambda_o}$$

Where $\nu_o$ is the **Threshold Frequency** which is the minimum amount of frequency required by the photon to just eject the electron from the metal surface.

And, 

Where $\lambda_o$  is the **Threshold Wavelength** which is the maximum wavelength required by the photon to just eject the electron from the metal surface. 

---

$$E_o - \phi = K.E._{max}$$

Where $E_o$ is the Energy of a photon ; $\phi$ is the Work Function ; $K.E._{max}$ is the Kinetic Energy of the photoelectron.

# Bohr's Model of the Hydrogen Atom

Bohr Adopted Rutherford's Model

1. The electron is revolving around the nucleus in the certain circular paths , which are called **orbits or stationary orbits**.
2. The energy of the electron in a stationary orbit does not change with time. Electrons **Emit** energy when they jump from **Higher to Lower** orbit and the **Gain** energy when they jump from **Lower to Higher** orbits.

    $$\Delta E = 13.6 \space z^2 (\frac{1}{n1^2} - \frac{1}{n2^2})$$

    Where $\Delta E$ is the energy released or absorbed in transition, $z$ is the atomic number , $n1$ is the orbit in which it was initially there, $n2$ is the orbit in which it reached after transition.

    1. Electron revolves around in the nucleus only in those circular orbits for which angular momentum of the orbit is the integral multiple of $\large\frac{h}{2\pi}$

        $$mvr = n \times \frac{h}{2\pi}$$

        Where $n$ is the Orbit Number or Principle Quantum Number

## Derivation of velocity and radius for H-like species

$F$ electrostatic = $Fe$ ; $F$ centrifugal = $Fc$

$$Fe = K \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$

$$Fc = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

Where $K = 9\times 10^9$ ; $m$ is the mass of the $e^-$; $v$ is the velocity of the $e^-$ ; $q_1$ is the charge on 1 $e^-$ ; $q_2$ is the charge on the nucleus ($Ze^-$)

As we know the force on $e^-$ are balanced

$$\therefore Fe = Fc$$

$$\implies K\frac{Ze \times e}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

                                                                                                $\Large\frac{KZe^2}{r} = mv^2$

- But we know from Bohr's Model

    $$mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi} \implies r = \frac{nh}{2\pi mv}$$

$$\frac{KZe^2}{r} = mv^2r$$

$$KZe^2 = mv^2 \times \frac{nh}{2\pi mv}$$

$$\therefore \implies v = (\frac{KZe^22\pi}{h}) \times \frac{Z}{n}$$

                                                                                        $\LARGE v = 2.18 \times10^6 \times \frac{Z}{n}\space m/s$

# Energy Formula for an $e^-$ reveling in H-like species

We know that : [1](https://www.notion.so/NCERT-Structure-of-an-Atom-f049991975554b1790227538da30bf75#bf23baab34784df88075336f74ccb0d2) 

$$\therefore \frac{1}{2} mv^2 =\frac {KZe^2}{2r} \implies K.E. = \frac{KZe^2}{2r}$$

And we know that

$$P.E. = K\frac{q1\cdot q2}{r} \implies K\frac{(+Ze)(-e)}{r} \implies -\frac{KZe^2}{r}$$

### Total Energy = K.E. + P.E.

$$\implies \frac{-KZe^2}{r} + \frac{KZe^2}{2r} \implies \frac{-2KZe^2  + KZe^2}{2r}$$

$$                                                                                            T.E. = \frac{-KZe^2}{2r}$$

$$T.E. = E_n =  \frac{-KZe^2}{2(r_o \times \frac{n^2}{z})} \times Z = (\frac{-Ke^2}{2r_o}) \times \frac{Z^2}{n^2}$$

                                                                         $\LARGE T.E. = E_n = -13.6 \times \frac{Z^2}{n^2}  \space eV$

                                                         $\LARGE K.E. = -T.E.\space \space \space \space \space \space ; \space \space \space \space \space \space P.E. = 2\times T.E.$ 

# Hydrogen Spectrum

- Continuous Spectrum - where one color merges into another and so on.

We know that if in an H-like atom the electron jumps from a higher to lower orbit , it releases energy , whereas when, an electron jumps from the lower to higher orbit, it absorbs energy and that energy is $\Delta E$ and :  (former orbit is $n1$ and latter is $n2$)

$$\Delta E = 13.6 \times z^2 (\frac{1}{n1^2}-\frac{1}{n2^2})$$

This is the energy of the photon which is absorbed or emitted, but the energy of the photon is $\large\frac{hc}{\lambda}$

$$\therefore \implies \frac{hc}{\lambda} = 13.6 \times z^2 (\frac{1}{n1^2}-\frac{1}{n2^2})$$

Which gives us :

$$\frac{1}{\lambda}=Rz^2(\frac{1}{n1^2}-\frac{1}{n2^2})$$

Where $R = \frac{13.6 eV}{hc} = 1.1 \times 10^ 7 m^{-1}$

## Emission Spectrum

The spectrum of radiation emitted by a substance that has absorbed energy is known as emission spectrum.

- Atoms/molecules absorb radiation the are said to "**exited**".

### Absorption Spectrum

Absorption spectrum is like the photographic negative of an emission spectrum

# Lyman Series

Series Limit = Infinity → 1st orbit

# Balmer Series

When $e^-$ in H-atom de-excites from any orbit greater than or equal to $3$ to the 2nd orbit, is called Balmer series. (Visible Rays)

Series Limit = Infinity → 2nd orbit 

# Paschen Series

When the H-atom electron jumps from the 4th orbit or higher to the 3rd orbit, then the series of spectral lines is called Paschen series. (Infrared)

Series Limit = Infinity → 3rd orbit

# Bracket Series

When electron jumps from the 5th orbit or higher to the 4tn orbit  in a H-atom, then the series of spectral lines obtained is called Brackett series

Series Limit = Infinity → 4th orbit

# Pfund Series

When an electron in an H-atom transits from the 6th orbit or higher to the 5th orbit, then the spectral lines series is called Pfund Series.

Series Limit = Infinity → 5th orbit

## Finding the number of different spectral lines

$$\text{number of spectral lines } = \frac{\Delta n(\Delta n+1)}{2}$$

Where $\Delta n$ is the difference of 2 orbits in which the electrons are making transition.

# De-Broglie Hypothesis

Any fast moving particle has both wave nature and particle nature, means it has dual nature.

$\Large \text{De-Broglie Wavelength : }\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}=\frac{h}{p}$

Where $h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \space J/s$ , and $mv = p = \text{Linear Momentum}$

- From Kinetic Energy

    $$K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

$\Large \lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2 \cdot m \cdot K.E.}}$

# Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle

It states that it is impossible to determine simultaneously  the exact position and the exact momentum of an electron or any other microscopic particle.

- Mathematically

    If uncertainty in momentum is $\Delta p$ and the uncertainty in position is $\Delta x$ , then according to Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle : ($h$ is Planck's Constant)

    $$\Delta x \times \Delta p \ge \frac{h}{4\pi}$$

    And substituting , $\Delta p=m\Delta v$ ($\Delta v$ is the uncertainty in velocity)

    $$\Delta x\times\Delta v \ge \frac{h}{4\pi m}$$

### Reasons for the failure of the Bohr Model

1. In the Bohr model, the $e^-$ is assumed to follow certain stationary paths, but after De-Broglie Hypothesis and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle  it is confirmed that the position of electron can not be determined and is uncertain.
2. Bohr model is not able to explain multi-electron atom

# Quantum Mechanical Model

In this , electrons are considered both **matter** **and wave** , means dual nature is considered.

The electron in the atom exists as electron wavefunction ($\Psi$)
(The electrons in the atoms can be described using quantum numbers)

## Structure of Atom (according to Quantum Mechanical Model)

Atom → Shells → Subshells → Orbitals → Electron

![Structure%20of%20an%20Atom%20d60446a70efc479a8a0ac618ca467378/Image_2.png](Structure%20of%20an%20Atom%20d60446a70efc479a8a0ac618ca467378/Image_2.png)

## Quantum Numbers

They are the set of 4 numbers which give complete information about an electron revolving in the atom.

### Principle Quantum Number ( $n$ )

It is the main energy level of the electron in the atom.

Higher the $n$ , higher the energy and higher is the distance from the nucleus.

Shell numbers : 
n=1 (K)
n=2 (L)
n=3 (M)
n=4 (N)

### Azimuthal Quantum Number ( $l$ )

Also known as , Angular Momentum Quantum Number or Subsidiary Quantum Number.

number of subshells in a shell = $n$

It defines the three dimesional space 

The value of $l$ depends on n
$l = 0 → n-1$

---

$l=0=s$ (Spherical Shape) 

$l=1=p$ (Dumbbell Shape)

$l=2=d$ (Double Dumbbell Shape)

$l=3=f$ (Complex - Many Dumbbells)

### Magnetic Quantum Number ( $m$ )

### Spin Quantum Number ( $s$ )
