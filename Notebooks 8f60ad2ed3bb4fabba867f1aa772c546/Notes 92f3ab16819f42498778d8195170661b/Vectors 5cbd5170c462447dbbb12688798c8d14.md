# Vectors

Stuff: JEE, Physics

- Table of Contents

Vectors are quantities which have both direction and magnitude.(Also units)

# Equality of vectors

Two vectors are only equal if their magnitude , direction and their unit are the same.

Multiplying -1 (negative) will change the direction to the opposite of the current. (Vice Versa)

# Addition of Vectors

## Triangle Law of Addition of Vectors

1. The resultant will be given by joining the head of the 1st vector to the tail of the 2nd vector , and the joining the remaining vertices for the resultant.
2. Where the magnitude of the resultant vector will be
 $|\vec c|= \sqrt{a^2+b^2+2a\cdot b\cdot \cos\theta}$

## Parallelogram Law of Addition of Vectors

1. The resultant will be given by joining both the tails and drawing imaginary equal line making a parallelogram, and the diagonal of the parallelogram will be the resultant.
2. Where the magnitude of the resultant vector will be $|\vec c|= \sqrt{a^2+b^2+2a\cdot b\cdot \cos\theta}$

# Subtraction of Vectors

In Subtraction we just add but by flipping the direction, that is $\vec a - \vec b$ = $\vec a + (-\vec b)$; 

## Triangle and Parallelogram Law for Subtraction

Same as the Addition Laws just the magnitude will be $|\vec c|= \sqrt{a^2+b^2-2a\cdot b\cdot \cos\theta}$

## Polygon law of Addition of Vectors

1. All the Vectors are joined by head to tail and the remaining side which would make a polygon is the resultant

Points to be noted : 
→ Resultant of two unequal vectors cannot be zero.
→ Resultant of three coplanar vectors may or may not be zero.
→ Resultant of three non-coplanar vectors cannot be zero.
