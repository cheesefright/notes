# 1 - Introduction

Mathematics is the supporting tool for Physics. The elementary knowledge of basic mathematics is useful in problem solving in Physics. Basic Knowledge of Elementary Algebra, Trigonometry, Coordinate Geometry and Basic Calculus is must before going into the depth of Physics.

# 2 - Elementary Algebra

Common formulae :

$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 +2ab$$

$$(a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 -2ab$$

$$(a+b+c)^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2 + 2(ab+bc+ca)$$

$$(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$$

$$(a+b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3ab(a+b)$$

$$(a-b)^3 = a^3-b^3-3ab(a-b)$$

$$(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2 = 4ab$$

$$(a+b)^2+(a-b)^2 = 2(a^2+b^2)$$

## 2.1 - Polynomial, Linear and Quadratic Equations

### 2.1.1 - Real Polynomial

Let $a_0,a_1,a-2,......a_n$ be real numbers and x is the variable , then $f(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+......+a_nx^n$ is called a real polynomial

### Degree of a polynomial

The highest power appearing in a polynomial is called its degree.

- $f(x)=x^3+8x+3$ ; the degree of this polynomial is $3$ .
- $f(x) = 3x^2y+y^2+2$ ; the degree of the polynomial is not two but is $3$ because of the variable y in $3x^2y$ where we will add the powers of $x$ and $y$ .

### Linear Inequations

Equations having polynomials of unit degree are called linear equations.

- $e.g. - (x+y=2),(2x+3=5),etc.$

They always represent a straight line on a graph.

### Quadratic Equations

Equations of second degree are called quadratic equations.

- This is the General Form ⇒ $ax^2+bx+c=0$

### Roots of a Quadratic Equation

Solutions of a quadratic equation are called its roots. Roots are those values of $x$ for which the equation is satisfied.

Root of the quadratic equations are generally re[resented by $\alpha$ and $\beta$

Let the equation be $ax^2+bx+c=0$

$\therefore$ $\Large\alpha=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and $\Large\beta=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

Hence the equation is solved by $\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

---

Sum of the roots $\Large\alpha + \beta = \frac{-b}{a}$

Difference of the roots $\Large\alpha - \beta =\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{a}$

---

Product of the roots $\Large\alpha\beta=\frac{c}{a}$

## 2.2 - Binomial Expression and Theorems

An algebraic expression containing two terms is called a binomial expression.

- $eg - (a+b),(x+\frac{1}{x})$

## 2.3 - Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Index

The general form of a binomial expression is $(x+a)^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer (called index) and $x$ and $a$ are real numbers.

The Binomial Theorem states :

$$(x+a)^n=\space ^nC_0x^n + \space ^nC_1x^{n-1}a^1 + \space ^nC_2x^{n-2}a^2+........\space^nC_rx^{n-r}a^r+.....+\space^nC_na^n$$

Where $\Large \space^nC_r=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

and $\large n!=n(n-1)(n-2).....3*2*1$  ( PRODUCT of first $n$ natural numbers )

- Clearly :
    - The total number of terms is $(n+1)$
    - In every successive term in the expansion, the power of goes on decreasing by 1 and that of $a$ increasing by 1, so that the sum of the powers of $x$ and $a$ in each term is always equal to $n$.
    - $\space^nC_0,\space^nC_1,\space^nC_2,.....\space^nC_n$ are called Binomial Coefficients.
    - In this expression $n!$ is read a ' n factorial '

        $\Large\space^nC_1 = \frac{n!}{1!(n-1)!}$ ⇒ $\Large\frac{n(n-1)(n-2).....3*2*1}{1(n-1)(n-2)......3*2*1}$ ⇒ $\large n$

        and Similarly , $\Large\space^nC_2=\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}$ ⇒ $\Large\frac{n!(n-1)}{2*1}$

        and therefore , $\Large{}\space^nC_n =1$

### Binomial Theorem for any Index

If $n$ is positive,negative integer or a fraction and x is any real number, such that $-1<x<1$ then according to the Binomial Theorem : 

$$(1+x)^n = 1+nx+\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}x^2+\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}x^3+........  \space\infty \space terms$$

- Note
    - If n is positive integer then expansion will have (n+1) terms
    - If n is negative integer or fraction, then number of terms in the expansion will be infinite, (there will be no last term)
    - If $|x| <<1$, then only first two terms of the expansion are significant
    It is so because the values of the second and the higher order terms become very small and can be neglected.
- In that case the theorem will look like this :

$$(1+x)^n = 1+nx$$

$$(1-x)^{-n}=1+nx$$

$$(1+x)^{-n} = 1-nx$$

$$(1-x)^n = 1-nx$$

# 2.4 - System of Measurement of an Angle

1. Sexagesimal System : 
    - 1 right angles = $90\degree$ ; $1\degree$ = $60'$ ; $1' = 60''$
2. Centesimal System :
    - 1 right angle = 100 grades (100g) ; 1 grade = 100 minutes( $100'$ ) ; 1 minutes = 100 seconds ( $100''$ )
3. Circular System
    - $\pi$ radians = $180\degree$ ; $1\degree = \frac{\pi}{180}$ radians
    - Consider a particle  moves from position P to the position Q along a circle of radius r with center O

        $$Angle \space\theta = \frac{\text{arc length}\space PQ}{\text{radius of the circle}\space r} = \frac{s}{r}$$

        $$s = r\theta$$

        $$1\space \text{rad} = \frac{360\degree}{2*3.14} = 57.3\degree$$

# 15 - Introduction to Vectors and Scalars

Vector quantities are quantities which have a magnitude as well as a direction, (and they obey the laws of Vector Addition).

Scalar quantities are nothing but quantities which only have magnitude.

- Note

    If a physical quantity is a vector it has a direction, but the converse may or may note be true, i.e. if a physical quantity has a direction it may or may note be a vector. For example, time, pressure, surface tension or current etc. have directions but are not vectors because they do not obey the laws of vector addition.

The magnitude of $\overrightarrow {\rm A}$ is the absolute value and is indicated by | $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ | .

# 16 - Representation of a Vector

Vector is represented by a straight arrow. The tail is a starting point, the head is the ending point and the line measure the direction. The length of the line gives the value or magnitude of the vector.

# 17 - Some Important Points About Vectors

### Equality of Vectors

$\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ = $\overrightarrow{\rm B}$ , only if A=B and the directions if $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ and $\overrightarrow{\rm B}$ are pointed in the same direction along parallel lines

fig 0

---

 Multiplying a vector $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ with a positive number $\lambda$ gives a vector $\overrightarrow{\rm B} = (\lambda \overrightarrow{\rm A})$ , whose magnitude is changed by the factor $\lambda$ but the direction is same  as that of $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$.

fig 1

---

Multiplying a vector $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ with a negative number $\lambda$ gives a vector  $\overleftarrow{\rm B}=(-\lambda\overrightarrow{\rm A})$ , whose directions is opposite to the direction of $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ and whose magnitude is $-\lambda$ time | $\overrightarrow{\rm A}$ | .

fig 2

## 17.1 - Addition of Vectors

Let us see an example , where if we add 10 and 10 the result is 20, but if we have 2 men pushing an object with a force 10N from opposite sides we know that the object won't move  and the resultant force would be 0.

Notice that $\overrightarrow{\rm A} + \overrightarrow{\rm B}  = \overrightarrow{\rm C}$ is very different from $A+B=C$. 

Therefore, we see that vectors obey different algebra known as vector algebra.

### 17.1.1 - Triangle Law of Addition of Vectors

If $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$ and $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ are two vectors to be added, a diagram is drawn in which the tail of $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ coincides with the head of $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$. The vector joining the tail of $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$ and the head of $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ is the resultant vector.

Triangle

### 17.1.2 - Parallelogram Law of Addition of Vectors

The same rule may be stated in a slightly different way. We draw vectors $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$ and $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ with both tails coinciding. Taking these two as the adjacent sides we complete the parallelogram. The diagonal through the common traits gives the sum of the two vectors.

Thus in the figure $\overrightarrow{\rm AB}+\overrightarrow{\rm AC}=\overrightarrow{\rm AD}$

parallelogram

## 17.2 - Subtraction of Vectors

Let $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$ and $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ bet wo vectors. We define $\overrightarrow{\rm a} - \overrightarrow{\rm b}$ as the sum of vector $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$ and the vector $(-\overrightarrow{\rm b} )$. To subtract $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ from $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$, invert the direction of $\overrightarrow{\rm b}$ and add to $\overrightarrow{\rm a}$.

Triangle subtract

### 17.2.1 - Polygon Law of Addition of Vectors

A geometric construction can also be used to add more than two vectors as shown in the figure for the case of 4 vectors. The resultant vector $\overrightarrow{\rm R} = \overrightarrow{\rm A}+\overrightarrow{\rm B} +\overrightarrow{\rm C}+\overrightarrow{\rm D}$ is the vector that completes the polygon. In other words, $\overrightarrow{\rm R}$ is then vector drawn from then tail of the first vector to the tip of the last vector.

This technique is often called  the "head to tail method"
