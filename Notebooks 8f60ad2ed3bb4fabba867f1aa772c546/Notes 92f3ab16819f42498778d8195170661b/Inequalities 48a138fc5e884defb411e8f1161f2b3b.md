# Inequalities

Stuff: Math, NCERT

# Rules

1. Equal Numbers may be added to both the sides of the inequality.
2. Equal Numbers non-zero may be multiplied and divide on both sides of the inequality.
3. If the number multiplied or divided is a negative number, the sign of the inequality has to be reversed.

# Number Line Method

- $-1<x\le3$
    1. Included - Filled Circle
    2. Not Included - Empty Circle

# Bracket Method

Order as in Number Line $(\space -\infty , x ,+\infty )$

1. Infinity / -Infinity ⇒ Open Brackets $(\space)$
2. Not Included ⇒ Open Brackets $(\space)$
3. Included ⇒ Closed Brackets $[\space]$
- $x\ge-2$

    $$x \in [\space -2 , \infty\space]$$

# Two Variable (graphical plotting)

- $3x + 2y > 6$
    1. Plot the line $3x+2y=6$
    2. There are 2 sides of the graph divided by the line , square and circle, and the square part satisfies the equation; $\therefore$ the right side of the line is the answer.

- $3x-6\ge0$
    1. Plot the line $3x-6=0 \implies x = 2$
    2. as the right side satisfies the equation it is the answer

- $x+y\ge5$ and $x-y\le3$
    1. Plot both lines
    2. The area which satisfies both the equation is your answer

- $5x+4y\le40$ and $x\ge2$ and $y\ge3$
    1. plot the lines
    2. the area which satisfies all your equations is your answer
