$$\text{Moles  }(\text{no.}) = \frac{\text{Given Mass}}{\text{Given Mass}}$$

$$\text{Mass \% of an element } = \frac{\text{Mass of element in 1 mole}}{\text{Molar Mass of the compound}}$$

# Empirical and Molecular Formula

Empirical Formula - It represents the simplest whole number ratios of various atoms present in the compound.

Molecular Formula -  It represents the exact number of different types of atoms present in a molecule of the compound

$$\text{Element }_n\text{| mass\% |}\frac{mass\%}{\text{atomic mass}}\text{| X}_n \text{|}\frac{X_n}{\text{smallest X}_n}\text{|Ans}_n$$

# Laws

## Law of Chemical Combinations - Antoine Lavoisier

- Law of conservation of mass
    1. In a chemical reaction mass of reacted reactants is always equal to the mass of the products.
    2. In a chemical reaction mass of all the substances before the reaction mass of all the substances before the reaction is equal to the mass of substances after the reactions. 

## Law of Constant Proportions - Joseph Proust

- A chemical compound always has fixed mass ratio of constituent elements irrespective of the origin of the compound.

## Law of Multiple Proportions - John Dalton

- If two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of 1 element that combines with a fixed mass of the other element , are in simple whole number ratios.

## Law of Reciprocal Proportions

- If different elements combine separately with the same weight of a third element, the ratio the masses in which they do sol are either the same or a simple multiple of the mass ratio in which they combine.

## Law of Gaseous Volumes - Gay Lussac

- When gases combine with each other in a chemical reaction, they do so in simple ratios of volume at same pressure and temperature

## Avogadro's Law

- At same temperature and pressure equal volumes of all the gases contain equal number of molecules.

At STP, the volume of 1 mole of any compound is equal to $22.4 l$ . 

STP (old) : (use this for JEE)

temperature - 273.15 K or 0 C

pressure - 1 atm = 1.01325 x $10^5$ Pascal

volume of 1 mole gas = 22.4 l

STP (new) : (use this for NEET)

temperature - 273.15 K or 0 c

pressure - 1 bar = $10^5$ Pascal

volume of 1 mole gas - 22.7 

$\Large \text{1 mole = molecular mass = 22.4 }l = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \space \text{atoms/molecules}$ 

# Density

## Absolute Density

Where this is valid for : Solid,Liquid and Gases.

$$\text{absolute density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} \implies d = \frac{m}{v}$$

## Relative Density in Gases

$$\text{Relative density}=\frac{\text{density of substance}}{\text{density of relative substance}} = \frac{\text{Molar mass of gas}}{\text{Molar mass of refernce gass}}$$

- Solid and liquids have this

    $$\text{Specific Gravity }= \frac{\text{density of substance}}{\text{density of water at } 4\degree C}$$

## Vapor Density

It is the relative density of any gas with density of $H_2$

$$\text{Vapor Density } = \frac{\text{Molar Mass of Gas}}{2}$$

# Chemical Reaction

In a Chemical reaction two or more substances react with each other to form products. In this process old bonds are broken and new bonds are formed.

### Significance of a balanced chemical reaction :

1. A balanced chemical reaction tells the reactants and products of the reaction.
2. A balanced reaction (chemical equation) shows the physical states of reactants and products.
3. in a balanced chemical reaction number of atoms of respective elements are same in the reactant side and product side.
4. The coefficients of reactants and products give the relative molar ratios of each reactant and product, and these are called stoichiometric coefficient

# Stoichiometry

$$\ce{2C_{(s)} + O_2_{(g)} -> 2CO_{(g)}}$$

2 mole of $C$ reacts with 22.4 l of $O_2$ to give 44.8 l of $CO$.

## 1 - Mole Mole analysis

$$\ce{N_2 + 3H_2 -> 2NH_3}$$

1 mole of $N_2$ and 3 mole of $H_2$ gives 2 mole of $NH_3$.

## 2 - Mass Mass Analysis

$$\ce{C + O_2 -> CO2}$$

12 g $C$ with 16 g of $O_2$ forms 44 g $CO_2$

## 3 - Mole Mass Analysis

$$\ce{2N_2 + 3O_2 -> 2N_2O_3 }$$

14 g of $N_2$ gives 0.75 moles of $O_2$ and 0.5 mole $N_2O_3$.
